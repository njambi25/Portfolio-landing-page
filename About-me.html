      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class=paragraph1>
        I am a 3D design artist and is passionate about pencil art,
        3D modeling and animation, a bit of sound production and photography.
        As a 3D designer my work is to create concept designs for space buildups
        including but not limited to expo stands, brand activations and offices spaces.
        Currently I'm taking a class in programming to expand my skills as i want to venture into
        UI Development.

    <h2>Background</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I started my design journey in early 2014 under the guidance of my friend Allan Mwaniki
        who introduced me to the industry through mentorship. I had the privilege of learning
        how to do storyboards and animatics for animated films through him. Later in 2015 I got
        a chance to work as a 3D concept designer where I got to experience and perfect my
        3D design skills. Working together with my friend who was also a former classmate,
        we founded a company later in the year, under the name Zugara Exhibitions Limited
        that is a 3D concept design and build company.
