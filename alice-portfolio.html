            <p>Alice is a 3D design artist and is passionate about pencil art,
               3D modeling and animation, a bit of sound production and photography.
               As a 3D designer my work is to create concept designs for space buildups
               including but not limited to expo stands, brand activations and offices spaces.

      <h2>About Me<h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            I started my design journey in early 2014 under the guidance of my friend Allan Mwaniki
            who introduced me to the industry through mentorship. I had the privilege of learning
            how to do storyboards and animatics for animated films through him. Later in 2015 I got
            a chance to work as a 3D concept designer where I got to experience and perfect my
            3D design skills. Working together with my friend who was also a former classmate,
            we founded a company later in the year, under the name Zugara Exhibitions Limited
            that is a 3D concept design and build company.
